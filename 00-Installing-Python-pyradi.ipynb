    "## Python and tools\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked which books she would recommend for newcomers to Python, my better half immediately said: find a real problem and good tools, then use Google search to solve the specific questions you run into.  This made me think.  Yes, Python is a computer programming language Yet, in its broader ecosystem is also so much more than just a language with syntax. Think of Python, its libraries and development environment as a set of problem solving tools, more than just a language. To use the tool set you need to know the language syntax, but you will find yourself quickly moving beyond the focus on a language towards focusing on solving the problem. It is almost as is the language will disappear as the focus shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to make the shift towards problem solving, you need a few building blocks in place:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do get to know the language syntax, especially the built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets (also study the advanced specialized container data types in the `collections` module). Build a solid insight into common programming idioms, often referred to the 'the Pythonic way' (https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) (this is very different from programming in traditional languages).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The really powerful tools in the Python toolset are the very many specialist packages (aka modules). Depending on your need these packages could be the scientific and data processing tools  (numpy, scipy, sympy, pandas, etc.), web and database tools (django, flask, alchemy, etc.), machine learning (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow), or specialist packages in astronomy, genomics, and many more fields.  Most technical applications would benefit from a good grounding in numpy, scipy, sympy, and pandas, thereafter extending to other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The 'best' development tool set can greatly aid in solving the problem. For scientific work the electronic lab book called Jupyter Lab is very popular. More conventional integrated development environment (IDE) include tools such as PyCharm (not free) and the free tools such as Spyder (available in Anaconda), or Visual Studio Code (do install the free Python extension by Microsoft).  At a more basic level any text editor can be used, because Python uses standard ASCII files for scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is most often installed as part of a bigger distribution that includes many more tools and packages than just the core Python interpreter.  For scientific work the Anaconda distribution is the most popular --- being very complete, it is also very large with a more than a gigabyte footprint on the hard disk. The minimal installation which includes only the core Python functionality which is powerful but excludes the specialist packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modern software development is almost unthinkable without a version control repository. The most popular tool here is git, with alternatives being subversion and mercurial.  Do use a repository for development work, even if just locally on your computer.  If you require off-site repository storage consider the likes of github or gitlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the trouble to learn the Markdown markup language, it is the de-facto standard in the code development world today. Scientific workers may also find benefit in using LaTeX for more advanced scientific and mathematical publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is most at home in a command window. Linux has several such terminals.  Windows users can surely move beyond the standard `cmd` terminal to something like https://conemu.github.io/ or PowerShell.\n",

    "Which integrated development environment (IDE) to install? You can write Python scripts with any ASCII editor (even notepad) and run the script in a command console.  Some people find it more productive to work in a more powerful IDE environment.  Finally, to build more comprehensive 'lab books' of your work with code, text, graphs, etc., use the IPython notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you need to run different versions of Python (e.g., 3.3 and 3.6), consider using the conda environment infrastructure.  A Conda environment is a new Python installation that lives alongside any other base installations or environment installations you already have.  Essentially every Conda environment is a separated Python installation. When you want to use the specific python in the environment, you activate the environment. Activation prepares a command window and sets up the paths to the Python version in that specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle here is that you create a thin root installation environment  that has the bare essentials to support conda and not much more.  You then create [conda environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) where you can install full anaconda versions of the the appropriate Python revisions.  You do the real work in the environments by activating the environment before running the python and packages in that environment.  When you create environments in conda, it creates a more or less complete Python installation in the ..../envs/ directory in an existing miniconda or anaconda installation.  So the multiple versions are installed side by side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activating an environment must be done in a command window; where the process of activation simply modifies the system level paths from the root environment to the newly activated environment.  The new environment is active in the present command window until the environment is deactivated, which means that the original paths to the Python folders are restored back to the root environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended practice to keep a small root environment, solely as a tool to create new environments - all the real work is done in the specially created environments.  This is a means to control which package versions for development, testing and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Python version 3.7). Note that the choice of which Miniconda is installed only affects the root environment. Regardless of which version of Miniconda you install, you can still install many different Python-version environments (even Python 2.7!).\n",

    "### The `*pth` file\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if I cloned the `https://github.com/NelisW/pyradi` module from github to my hard disk at `V:/work/WorkN/pyradi`, I can place a file in the root and or environment `site-packages` folder(s)  with the name `pyradi.pth` that contains the line `V:/work/WorkN/pyradi/pyradi`.  Note that in this case `pyradi` is installed at a particular location, but the path written to the file is further down the folder structure with an additional `pyradi`.

You can then create different conda environments where each environment has its own unique and different `.pth` file, pointing to the specific code you want to use with that specific environment.

    "It is not clear from the documentation, but the paths to the modules listed in the pht file must be _relative_ to one of the site packages directories. These directories are where Python would look for modules.  Absolute paths do not seem to work (at least on Windows, the are Linux examples that do have absolute paths).  If your module is located on the same disk as `.../site-packages/`, then it appears necessary to provide a path relative to this `.../site-packages/`, i.e., something like `../../../pathtomodule`.  If the module is not on the same disk/drive as `.../site-packages/`, you should probably set up a secondary site-packages directory on the other disk (using `addsitedir`).\n",

This means that if the file is created on Windows and executed on Linux the operating system is searching to execute the file `python/r`, which is very different from the intended `python`.  I tried converting the file from Windows to Linux format by using the `fromdos` command, but that did not fix the line ending problem.  Opening and closing the file in `nano` did not help either.  The only remedy was to (1) open the file in Linux (e.g. in `nano`), move to the top of the file, (2) manually type in the whole first line followed by `Enter` a few times, making very sure that a new Linux line ending is introduced, and (3) then remove the old line with the bad line ending.\n",
